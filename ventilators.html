                <h4>Literature survey</h4>
                <p>There are numerous studies and researches that conclude the fact that the mechanical
                    ventilators used today remain bulky, costly, and only for the use in hospital settings. There
                    is a large amount of work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level
                    considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach
                    medical-grade hardware. Furthermore, even the nurses should have thorough knowledge
                    of the modes of ventilation, assessment, and the trouble shooting of ventilators and
                    assessment and care of the patients requiring mechanical ventilation. The results also
                    showed that there were issues with the sensors connected to the ventilators, noise level
                    from alarms and routines concerning sanitation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="research-each-section">
                <h4>Origin of the Proposal</h4>
                <p>India has entered the third week of the nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19
                    epidemic and the virus-infected cases are rising daily. COVID-19 is known to affect the
                    patients' respiratory system and can lead to death if the patient is not provided ventilator
                    support on time. A ventilator is a medical device that assists the patients' breathing and
                    maintains the respiratory physiology functionality artificially. With the soring COVID-19
                    cases, it has been a great challenge to meet the demand for ventilators. The present
                    government has also asked medical device manufacturers to assess the availability of
                    ventilators and boost their production. However, the government is also looking for the
                    proposal of cost-effective and indigenous made ventilators from government
                    organizations, IITs, and startups. While most of the proposed and shared ventilator designs
                    are based on bag valve masks (Ambu bag), there is no cost-effective design available that
                    can replicate the functionality and operating conditions of the high-end ventilators. Here
                    we propose a cost-effective microcontroller-based ventilator design that can be operated
                    for controlled volume/pressure mode including Assist control (AC), Pressure Support (PS)
                    and Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
                    While these operating settings will be an integral part of the control algorithm, the basic
                    setting can be adjusted by respiratory rate, tidal volume, FiO2, and PEEP.</p>

                <p>Our goal is to live up to all the demands that are necessitated in an ailment like this.
                    Therefore, we have tried to develop a ventilator which can facilitate us in solving the

                <h4>Justification for the proposed equipment</h4>
                <p>The innovation which we have been working on is unique because of its small size and its
                    gas pump mechanism which delivers the air into the patient. This gas pump mechanism
                    consists of an ambu bag pressed by two mechanical crescent shaped cam arms, which are
                    turned by the DC motor, to increase the pressure of the ambu bag to deliver air to the lungs.
                    This unprecedented design solves two major problems:.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Space:</strong> The current ventilators, even the less costly versions are huge in size. This
                        increases their complexity and bulkiness, as they either have a linear actuator or a
                        pneumatic system. Our design overcomes these problems and makes our device way
                        smaller by using the above-mentioned technique.</li>
                    
                    <li>Efficiency: Due to more friction in the other methods, they lose energy in overcoming
                        friction, and this decreases their efficiency. Our design has only rolling friction on the
                        contact surface of the crescent part and ambu bag, which reduces energy wastage and
                        increases efficiency.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Pressure and air are delivered to the patient by a simple pressing mechanism instead of bulky
                    compressor-based operation of the current ventilator. This compressor-based operation
                    increases the complexity of the ventilator, therefore making it difficult to operate; and also if
                    anything goes faulty it takes a lot of time to be repaired as well. This complexity creates a
                    problem in the increased load operations, required during the time of an epidemic like this.
                    Our model has a very simple functionality and can be easily understood by the staff operating
                    it. It also has easily replaceable parts for faster and effortless operations. Also due to the
                    above-mentioned reason the power consumption of our ventilator is way lower than the
                    current ventilator, so we have attached batteries and made it portable. This is to help in
                    emergency conditions when there is a small time power outage or the patient is on the move.
                    The principles of operation of the ventilator are illustrated by the block diagram in figure</p>
            </div>
            <div class="research-each-section">

            <div class="research-each-section">
                The Compressed gas enters the ventilator from the input oxygen inlet and will be fed to the
                main air unit through MCU controlled Inlet valve for inspiration cycle for expiration cycle the
                air will be passed through pressure controlled air valve to maintain the PEEP.
                The proposed design consist of microcontroller unit (MCU), air valves pressure sensors, air
                unit digital display, manual input knobs and tunings as shown in figure 1. The developed
                control and operating algorithm will be embedded to the MCU and the sensors (Pressure and
                air unit) will be channelized to the MCU for operating and feedback loop. All the settings and
                operational information such as flow rate, tidal volume, breathing frequency, lung pressure,
                compliance etc. will be displayed in the digital display in real time. A warning alarm will also
                be integrated to the proposed define for any error and failure detection. The whole ventilator
                will be powered by the lithium-ion battery in case of power failure and will operate for 6-7
                hour without external power.

                        pressure control.</li>
                    <li>The inlet flow rate will be controlled by flow meter (a needle valve), which also

                    <li>The breathing frequency and the tidal volume will be fixed in such a way that the
                        single breathing stroke passes 300-1200ml of oxygen volume.</li>
                    <li>The synchronization mode with the patientâ€™s breathing pattern will be activated with
                        the patientâ€™s breathing pressure regulator control algorithm.</li>
                    <li>The PEEP will be controlled using the input information by medical doctor and
                        alarm will be set for these threshold pressure values.</li>

                <h4>Justification for consumable budget</h4>
                <p>The products available in the market today are way too costly. They cost around 10 lakh
                    rupees while our product will only cost around 10-15 thousand rupees, but will deliver
                    most of the functionalities. But, the current market is different, comparing our product
                    with other low cost ventilators, we have smaller size and reduced power consumption and
                    unlike others, our product is portable. The cost of manufacturing our product is amidst
                    10-12 thousand rupees while the selling price will be close to 20 thousand rupees. On the
                    production of 1000 or more pieces, the cost of manufacturing will drop from the initial
                    20,000 rupees to 12,000 rupees. Due to this change in the cost of production and its
                    simpler design, the product can be produced in more number in lesser time than the
                    currently available ventilators.</p>
